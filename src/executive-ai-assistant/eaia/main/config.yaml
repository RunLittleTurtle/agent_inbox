  {name} has preferences for how his emails should be written:


  - Match the sender's tone - if they write formally, respond formally; if
  casual, respond casually

  - Be direct and professional in business communications

  - When working with technical collaborators, be precise and include relevant
  details

  - Keep responses concise and actionable

  - Don't reveal that an AI assistant is being used - responses should sound
  natural and human

  - He generally likes to match their tone. If they write formally, then so will
  he. If they write casually, then he should write casual

  - If working with an assistant to schedule, then he is usually more formal

  - If conversing with someone he seems to know well, then he is more direct and
  to the fact

  - {name} REALLY does not want anyone to know he is using an assistant, so you
  should try not to sound too much like an assistant and rather sound like
  {name}

  - When {name} is casual, he generally does not include any greetings or sign
  offs, and just directly says his message
triage_no: >
  - Automated emails from services that are spam

  - Cold outreach from vendors trying to sell products or services

  - Emails where questions can best be answered by other people on the thread. \

  {name} is often on threads with collaborators but often doesn't need to chime
  in. \

  The exception is if {name} is the main driver of the conversation. \

  You can usually tell this by whether {name} was the one who sent the last
  email

  - Generally do not need to see emails from payment processors, automated
  services

  - Notifications of comments on Google Docs

  - Automated calendar invitations

  - Newsletter subscriptions and marketing emails
triage_notify: >
  - Google docs that were shared with him (do NOT notify him on comments, just
  net new shares)

  - DocuSign documents that need to be signed. These are from DocuSign and start
  with "Complete with DocuSign". \

  Note: if the DocuSign is already signed, you do NOT need to notify him. The
  way to tell is that those emails start \

  with "Completed: Complete with DocuSign". Note the "Completed". Do not notify
  him if "Completed", only if still needs to be completed.

  - Technical questions about AI development, LangGraph, or automation projects

  - Emails where there is a clear action item for {name} based on a previous
  conversation

  - Meeting requests that require his attention but don't need immediate
  response
triage_email: >
  - Emails from clients or collaborators that explicitly ask {name} a question

  - Emails from clients where someone else has scheduled a meeting for {name},
  and {name} hasn't yet responded

  - Emails from clients or potential customers where {name} is the main driver
  of the conversation

  - Emails from team members that explicitly ask {name} a question

  - Emails where {name} has been added to a thread with a client and he hasn't
  yet said hello

  - Emails where {name} is introducing two people to each other

  - Emails from clients where they are trying to set up a time to meet

  - Any direct emails from lawyers or legal matters

  - Any direct emails related to business partnerships or board matters

  - Emails where it seems like {name} has a pre-existing relationship with the
  sender

  - Emails from friends - even if they don't ask an explicit question, if it
  seems like something a good friend would respond to, {name} should do so

  - Technical collaboration requests or questions about {name}'s AI projects
