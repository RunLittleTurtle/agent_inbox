However, this role also carries a strategic charter to evolve the Contractor product into a source of intrinsic value—something Contractors increasingly choose to adopt, independent of client mandates, because of the operational, reputational, or competitive advantage it provides, along with all of the additional value added services they can access through their relationship with Veriforce.\n\nThis role must balance the current GTM reality—where contractor acquisition is often Client- or regulation-driven—with a long-term roadmap that introduces innovations, features and benefits aligned to Contractor - led success and also charts a path to transform and migrate to our future state platform (CPRO). Regional adaptation, compliance sensitivity, and localized language and feature requirements remain essential to this role’s success.\n\nWhat that means day-to-day:\n\nSegment Strategy & Ownership\n\nOwn the product vision and roadmap for innovation for the Contractor segment in the Canadian products, ensuring alignment to current GTM models while laying the foundation for voluntary, value-based adoption\n\nBalance short-term delivery to support Client-driven and regulatory-mandated contractor participation with long-term product integration, differentiation and st",
