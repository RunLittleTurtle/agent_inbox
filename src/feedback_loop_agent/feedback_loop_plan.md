One of the important feature we will need before giving it to Simon, is the feedback loop. This feedback loop will allow Simon to provide feedback on the agent's performance. For every interaction, the agent will receive feedback on its performance. If it's good, a thumbs up, if bad a thumbs down with mandatory comments. The nall these are going to be stored in a database. We will need the following metadata:
- Agent ID
- Interaction ID
- Feedback Type (thumbs up/down)
- Feedback Comment
- Timestamp
- Tools invoked in trace
- Trace ID
